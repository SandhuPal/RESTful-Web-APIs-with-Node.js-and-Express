Building RESTful Web APIs with Node.js and Express<br>


<b>npm init</b> = command to create a package.json<br>
<b>npm i --save express</b>  = Expressjs is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework<br>
[install the mongoDB]<br>
<b>npm i --save mongoose</b> = mongodb object modeling for node.js (writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag. That's why we wrote Mongoose). Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.<br>

<b>npm i -save nodemon</b> = nodemon reload, automatically. Automatic restarting of application. Detects default file extension to monitor.<br>

<b>npm i -save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-0</b> = Babel convert ECMAScript code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
